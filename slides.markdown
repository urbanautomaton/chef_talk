## What's this about?

The levels of provisioning:

1. Hand-configured servers
2. Cobbled-together provisioning scripts
3. `$DEPLOYMENT_TOOL` managing scripts
4. Single-server chef/puppet
5. Centralised configuration management

## What's this about?

Stop thinking of deployment as an unspeakable thing that happens to our
beautiful code after we've written it, and start thinking of our code as
meaningless until it's embodied in a production system.

not sure about the second bit of that, but work on it

re tom stuart's point about Rails' deployment story being ghastly:

Okay, so chef may not buy us simplicity, but it buys us a way of
managing complexity. We still need the former, but we can mitigate the
latter
